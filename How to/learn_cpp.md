title: "C++ Resources"

Some folks may be interested in learning C++ through this course.  If you have some familiarity with a compiled language (Java, C, Swift, Kotlin, C#) you may be in a good position to try this.  I hope that we can work together to identify good resources and create a self-study so that other students can learn C++ through this course.

## Sample Resources

I'm going to start by listing a few C++ educational resources that have been recommended highly online.  I have not gone through any of these in detail, so some vetting will be necessary.  I hope we can build this out together.

* [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)
* [Linear C++](https://github.com/jesyspa/linear-cpp)

## ROS2 Specific Gudies

* [Combining C++ and Python in one ROS2 Package](https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-package-for-both-python-and-cpp-nodes/).
