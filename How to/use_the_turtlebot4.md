title: "Using the Turtlebot 4"

This document is a work in progress.  We have purchased a Turtlebot4 Lite, and we have played around with it a bit (definitely a cool platform!).  If you'd like to use this platform for any project, just send Paul an e-mail and we'll get you going.

# ROS Setup

Currently the Turtlebot4 packages only work on ROS2 Galactic.  This means that your best best is to use Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS2 Galactic.  Go back to the [Setting up Your Environment](setup_your_environment) document, and run through the instructions with each instace of ``foxy`` changed to ``galactic``.
