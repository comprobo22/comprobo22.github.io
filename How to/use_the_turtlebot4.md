This document is a work in progress.  We have purchased a Turtlebot4 Lite, and we have played around with it a bit (definitely a cool platform!).  If you'd like to use this platform for any project, just send Paul an e-mail and we'll get you going.

# ROS2 Setup

The best source of info on using the Turtlebot4 is at the [manufacturer's website](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/).  I have already done the setup on the Turtlebot4 side, but you can run the following command to get the code on your laptop.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlebot4-desktop
```

Once you've done the general setup, you can try running some of the [tutorials from the Turtlebot4 site](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/tutorials/).
