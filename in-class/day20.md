## Today

* Share learning goals with teammates
* Meet with instructors about project proposal

## For Next Time

* Keep working on the [final project](../assignments/final_project).

## Learning Goals Discussion

The last section of the project proposal is:

> Given each of your YOGAs, in what ways is this project well-aligned with these goals, and in what ways is it misaligned? If there are ways in which it is not well-aligned, please provide a potential strategy for bringing the project and your learning goals into better alignment. There should be an individual section for each person on the team addressing the fit between the YOGA and the project topic.

Work with your teammates during class today to fill this section out.  You will be submitting your proposal by the end of class.

## Project Proposal Discussion

While you are working on the learning goals section, Kene and I will be meeting with each team to discuss your plans for the project.  Please come ready to describe your project and general plan.  Let us know how we can support you.  We will have roughly 10 minutes with each team, so we'll need to keep things brief.
